        </h3>
        <h5 class="padding-none justify">
          Plankton Company was founded in 1995 by Dr. Plankton Singh, 
          our Head of Research Faculty. He had suffered an unfortunate loss 
          which gave him the idea to create Plankton Company so that society no longer had to grieve as he did.
          <br> Since then, we have hired many talented scientists who have greatly contributed to our research and development. 
          Plankton Company hopes to recruit more people to play a part in moving forward in the near future. 
          <br> We are currently undertaking the BIO-TECH-413 Human Experiment Project (BTHEP) and have made
          many new discoveries thanks to our co-operative participants.
          <br><br>
          Here are some achievements that Plankton Company have attained: 
          <br><b>1996 Best Start-Up BIOTECH Company</b>
